= Radiant Commodity

This is a simple extension that exposes page and snippet data at urls
without layouts so that the content can be imported by external projects.

For Rails projects you can use the plugin RadiantConsumer at
http://github.com/boost/radiant-consumer to import the Radiant content into
a rails view.

== EXAMPLE

After installation each page will be available at /page/page/url. If you had
an about page at /about the content can be accessed at /page/about.

== PARTS

Page parts are available by appending the part name to the url. For example
an about page footer would be available at /page/about/footer.

== SNIPPETS

Snippets are available at /snippets/name
